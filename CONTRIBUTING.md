# Contributing to $PPR

Thank you for your interest in contributing to **$PPR — Poor Pull Request**.

Please read this document carefully. Very carefully. Especially if your change is small.

---

## Guiding Principles

* Every contribution is welcome
* Every contribution will be judged
* The smaller the change, the higher the standards

If your PR changes **one character**, this repository will treat it as a *ceremonial act*.

---

## Before You Open a Pull Request

Ask yourself the following questions:

1. Could this have been a single commit?
2. Could this have been squashed?
3. Could this have been avoided entirely?
4. Did I still open a PR anyway?

If you answered **yes** to #4, please continue.

## Contribution Size Requirements

### 🧘 Zero-Change PRs

PRs that introduce **no changes** are permitted but discouraged.

Requirements:

* A clear explanation of intent
* A calm mindset
* Acceptance that nothing will happen

---

### 👑 One-Character Changes (Ceremonial Tier)

Examples:

* Adding or removing a `.`
* Fixing a single typo
* Adding a missing newline

**Additional requirements:**

* PR description must be **at least 200 words**
* Include a screenshot, even if irrelevant
* Mention the word *"process"* at least once
* Acknowledge that this could have been a commit

Failure to meet these requirements may result in **instant approval**.

---

### 🚩 Two to Five Characters (Poor Pull Request Tier)

Examples:

* Minor formatting changes
* Renaming a variable (no behavior change)
* Removing trailing whitespace (bravely)

Requirements:

* Justify why batching was impossible
* Pretend CI mattered here
* Accept the `poor-pull-request` label with grace

---

### 😐 More Than Five Characters

Congratulations.

You have submitted what appears to be a real pull request.

Please follow standard open-source contribution etiquette and try not to enjoy it too much.

---

## Code Style

* Follow existing conventions
* Do not improve anything unrelated
* Do not refactor unless explicitly unnecessary
* Do not introduce clarity where ambiguity previously existed

---

## Reviews

* Expect automated comments
* Expect labels
* Do not argue with the bot
* The bot is correct

If your PR is auto-approved, please do not celebrate publicly.

---

## Merging

* Squash merges are encouraged
* Force pushes are tolerated
* Quiet regret is expected

---

## Final Notes

By opening a pull request, you agree that:

* This repository may mock your change
* Screenshots of your PR may be shared
* You brought this upon yourself

Thank you for contributing.

LGTM 👍.
